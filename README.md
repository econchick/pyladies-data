# Diversity: We're not done yet

This repo is an accompanyment to the data used in my recent talk, [Diversity: We're not done yet](http://www.roguelynn.com/words/were-not-done-yet/).

While I didn't use Pandas for the visualizations like above (I just used Keynote.app), this is the exact same data.

**Note:** I did not include all the JSON data files since it takes up about 195 MBs; but running the IPython notebooks should give you the same (but more updated) data.

## To install & use

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/econchick/pyladies-data.git
$ cd pyladies-data
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(env) $ ipython notebook
```

Then go play in the notebooks!
